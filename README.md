- **Interactive & searchable campus map**
- **Building details & facility info**

## 📌 Core Features (Explained)

### 🗺️ **Interactive Campus Map**
Users can explore the campus map with:

- Pinch-to-zoom and smooth panning  
- Tappable hotspots for buildings
- Visual markers for key locations such as libraries, labs, lecture halls, cafe spots, and parking areas.

This allows users to **visually identify locations** rather than relying on text lists alone.

---

### 🔍 **Real-Time Search**
The app lets users search for:

- Building names
- Departments
- Facilities (e.g., cafeteria, gym, admin block)
- Points of interest

Search results dynamically filter as the user types for faster discovery.

---

### 🏫 **Building & Facility Details**
Each location has its own detail screen with:

- Building name
- Image / icon
- Operational hours
- Department list
- Directions & shortest path from current location

This positions the app as more than a simple map — it’s an **information hub** for campus life.

---

### 📅 **Events & Calendar**
The app shows campus events:

- Weekly schedules
- Special announcements
- Club activities
- Academic deadlines

Users can view details, RSVP, or add events to their personal calendar.

---

### 🚶‍♂️ **Smart Routing & Directions**
Users get optimized walking paths between:

- Current location to a destination
- One building to another
- Indoor & outdoor transitions

Future versions could integrate **GPS navigation** or **indoor positioning** via Bluetooth beacons.

---

### 👤 **User Profile & Preferences**
Users can save:

- Home location
- Favorite routes
- Frequently visited buildings  
- Accessibility preferences (e.g., wheelchair accessible paths)

Preferences improve future navigation and personalization.
